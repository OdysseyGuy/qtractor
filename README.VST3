Native VST3 plug-in support
---------------------------

Unlikely to what it was for VST, that meaning for the old VST 2.x,
building for the newer VST3 plug-in support is probably easier and
a lot less license-encumbered, if you know what I mean ;).

You still need to download the most recent VST3 SDK from the official
site though. Let's recapitulate:

  Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH
  https://www.steinberg.net

  Steinberg 3rd Party Developers
  https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

Once downloaded and unzipped you may proceed to build for VST3 plug-in
support, with the following magic spell:

  cmake -DCONFIG_VST3SDK=/path/to/VST_SDK/vst3sdk ...


Or, you may choose to go with the GitHub's route instead:

  GitHub - VST 3 Plug-In SDK
  https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk

Please note that, in the later case, you'll get the VST3 SDK and only;
you won't get the VST2.x legacy stuff whatsoever, as you probably, just
probably, still get with the former route.

You may now choose your permanent location on your file-system to clone
the source code tree and proceed, while taking care of all sub-modules
as well:

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk

Similarly, as before, you may now proceed with the build, starting from
this point:

  cmake -DCONFIG_VST3SDK=/path/to/vst3sdk ...

Note that you only need to have the original VST3 SDK source available.
You don't really need to build or deploy any of the VST3 SDK binaries,
libraries or otherwise sample programs and plug-ins--unless you want to,
of course ;).

That is, only the following VST3 SDK source code tree folders are needed
to build Qtractor with VST3 Plug-in support enabled:

  - VST SDK 3.x:
    VST_SDK/vst3sdk/
      base
      pluginterfaces
      public.sdk


Lest to say, that this is all very experimental stuff, so the (in)formal
disclaimer applies, as always: there is NO GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER, whether
explicit or implied, that it'll ever work for you or to anybody else--you
are hereby advised ;).

Enjoy.
